            <h1>Feylost</h1>
            
            <p><em>You grew up in the Feywild after disappearing from your home plane as a child. Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a Fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild&#39;s spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there.</em></p>
<p><em>When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact the Feywild-a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception-is only a hair&#39;s breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie-your home away from home.</em></p>

<h2 id="feywild-visitor">Feywild Visitor</h2>
<p>Whenever you&#39;re sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit&#39;s form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM&#39;s discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can&#39;t speak that language normally.</p>

<h2 id="feywild-connection">Feywild Connection</h2>
<p>Your mannerisms and knowledge of fey customs are recognized by natives of the Feywild, who see you as one of their own. Because of this, friendly Fey creatures are inclined to come to your aid if you are lost or need help in the Feywild.</p>
